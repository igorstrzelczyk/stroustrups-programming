# Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++
This repository contains proposed solutions to selected end of chapter exercises from
Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++".

The point of this is to showcase my approach to presented problems, style of coding
and to potentially aid fellow self-taught would-be developers.

While most likely not optimal, all of the presented code is working and has been thoroughly,
personally tested.
